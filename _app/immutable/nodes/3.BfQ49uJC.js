Works are coded, functional, and typically accessible via the internet or a web browser. The creators practiced design during production, combining text and graphics to engage visitors, implementing code for the sites&#39; presentation and behavior, or in how they planned for intentional experiences, regardless how a visitor might categorize them as works of activism, humor, experimentation, art, or some combination thereof.

	This website presents and contextualizes such works using various themes, categories, and technologies, acknowledging the diverse creative practices that have emerged online, both within and outside the narrow definition of &quot;Art&quot;.
