		Critical Web Design is a broad category that includes internet art, creative activism, and cultural production.
		Works are coded, functional, and typically accessible via the internet or a web browser. The creators practiced
		design during production, combining text and graphics to engage visitors, implementing code for the sites'
		presentation and behavior, or in how they planned for intentional experiences, regardless how a visitor might
		categorize them as works of activism, humor, experimentation, art, or some combination thereof. This website
		presents and contextualizes such works using various themes, categories, and technologies, acknowledging the diverse
		creative practices that have emerged online, both within and outside the narrow definition of "Art". For more
		information see: <i>Critical Web Design</i> by xtine burrough and Owen Mundy (MIT Press, forthcoming)
