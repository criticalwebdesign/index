of Something' is a contemporary remake of John Berger‚Äôs BBC documentary, ‚Äú Ways of Seeing ‚Äù (1972). The project consists of one-minute videos by over 113 network-based artists who commonly work with 3D rendering, gifs, film remix, webcam performances, and websites to describe the cacophonous conditions of artmaking after the internet. Curated and compiled by Lorna Mills.\"</blockquote>","moreinfo1":"","moreinfo2":"","moreinfo3":"","media":"mills-ways-of-something","archive":"","total":null,"slug":"ways-of-something","tags":["all","animation","collection","documentary","education","glitch","index"]},{"title":"Internet Archaeology","url":"","start":2009,"end":0,"status":"üòø","author1":"","author1Url":"","author2":"","author2Url":"","author3":"","author3Url":"","author4":"","author4Url":"","publisher":"","publisherUrl":"","code":"","100examples":"","description":"","moreinfo1":"","moreinfo2":"","moreinfo3":"","media":"","archive":"x","total":null,"slug":"internet-archaeology","tags":["all","cats","collection","documentary","humor","index","maintenance","utility"]},{"title":"Gallery 9","url":"http://gallery9.walkerart.org/","start":1997,"end":2003,"status":"","author1":"","author1Url":"","author2":"","author2Url":"","author3":"","author3Url":"","author4":"","author4Url":"","publisher":"Walker Art Center","publisherUrl":"","code":"","100examples":"","description":"","moreinfo1":"","moreinfo2":"","moreinfo3":"","media":"","archive":"","total":null,"slug":"gallery-9","tags":["all","collection","index"]},{"title":"Artport","url":"https://whitney.org/artport","start":2001,"end":0,"status":"","author1":"","author1Url":"","author2":"","author2Url":"","author3":"","author3Url":"","author4":"","author4Url":"","publisher":"Whitney Museum of American Art","publisherUrl":"","code":"","100examples":"","description":"artport is the Whitney Museum's portal to Internet art and an online gallery space for commissions of net art and new media art.
