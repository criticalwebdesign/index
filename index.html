      Critical Web Design is a broad category that includes internet art, creative activism, and cultural production. Works are built, functional, and typically networked or used online or with computers in public. Finally, they are intentional in their production so as to cause users to think deeply about some tech or related issue. This document contextualizes these using various themes, categories, technologies that epitomize these types of works.
