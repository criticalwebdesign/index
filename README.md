# Critical Web Design Index

Critical Web Design is a broad category that includes internet art, creative activism, and cultural production. Works are coded, functional, and typically accessible via the internet or a web browser. The creators practiced design during production, combining text and graphics to engage visitors, implementing code for the sites' presentation and behavior, or in how they planned for intentional experiences, regardless how a visitor might categorize them as works of activism, humor, experimentation, art, or some combination thereof.

This website presents and contextualizes such works using various themes, categories, and technologies, acknowledging the diverse creative practices that have emerged online, both within and outside the narrow definition of "Art".

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
